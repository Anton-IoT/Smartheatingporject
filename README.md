# Smartheatingproject

The concept is that the leds are suppose to be heating for your rooms where you can control them via the app blynk.
each led are there for a certain room for example 1 of the led is meant for a bathroom. and 1 for example the bedroom.
each room requires a certain temperature for example: *an ideal bathroom temperature is 24ºc and the bedroom 20ºc*.
I have programmed the leds so that they will turn on when its too cold and will turn off when they reach the desired temperature
for a certain room. on this project I want to use 2 different sensors each sensor are meant for a room for example:
The BMP280 is meant for the bathroom and a DHT11 sensor is meant for the bedroom.
